UTFT_Analog_Clock_Mega_Mine
===========================

Analogue digital clock temperature display


This code uses the UTF  library, the DA1307 RTC library and the Radiohead library to receive temperature readings from my garage. Version one uses 433Mhz transmitter and receiver. I plan to change to nRF24L0 for better transmittions and range. 433Mhz module are very sensitive and I ama getting 30 meters between my office and my garage. There is only one spot in my garage that makes a connection.
